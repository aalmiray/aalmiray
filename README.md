Hi! I'm an avid Open Source software developer and co-founder of the Hackergarten initiative. I love building software that can help solve problems around the world. I've been actively involved with Open Source since my first contribution to Apache Commons-Lang back in 2006; next up I created my first pair of Open Source projects (Json-lib & EZMorph), followed by joining the Groovy (nowadays Apache Groovy) development team a year after. I'm quite proficient writing Java code, Gradle and Maven plugins, as well as JavaFX libraries. Golang is great as well!

Organizations I contribute to include:

* [github.com/jreleaser](https://github.com/jreleaser)
* [github.com/kordamp](https://github.com/kordamp)
* [github.com/griffon](https://github.com/griffon)
* [github.com/asciidoctor](https://github.com/asciidoctor)
* [github.com/hackergarten](https://github.com/hackergarten)
* [github.com/moditect](https://github.com/moditect)
* [github.com/sshoogr](https://github.com/sshoogr)

My goal is to keep contributing to Open Source and help others do the same. With your help I'll be able to continue promoting Open Source and make the world a better place, one commit at a time.
